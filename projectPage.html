	<h3>Metanarchy</h3>
		<br>
	<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
		A little personal project of mine, Metanarchy is a piece of science fiction media that revolves around the infamous mad general Riggs and his fight against the United Federation and to free its grip on mankind. Taking inspiration from various sources and filled with a multitude of unique alien races and rich characters, the aim of this project is to create a unique universe that combines traits of retro, 80's era, and modern science fiction and to tell a rich, fantastical story around the concept of morality and perspective.

	<h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>
		"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe." -Frederick Douglass

In 2099, with the turn of the 22nd century approaching, an intelligent radio signal originating near Neptune was intercepted, with scientists theorizing that the broadcast was deliberately aimed at Earth. On the eve of the new year, the signal’s broadcasters finally make their entrance to the world, introducing themselves as the Eriani, or as humanity knew them through countless media, the Martians. Having made themselves familiar with Human languages and cultures through copious study, the Eriani offered humanity a compromise; to share their technological and scientific prowess and allow humanity to join the galactic community in exchange for displaying peace and unity as a species, with the Eriani having observed the many atrocities Mankind has committed.

By 2103, on the anniversary of the formation of their promise, Humanity developed its first faster-than-light capable spacecraft and become a type-1 civilization, celebrating as they join the galactic community. Later that year, Humanity and the Eriani undertook their first joint operation, looking to terraform and colonize Mars and restore it back into a habitable planet. In 2110, Humanity makes first contact with the Reticulans, later establishing tense diplomatic relations with the superstitious race. By 2200, as humanity manages to colonize over a dozen star systems, the organization once known as the United Nations is officially dissolved, later reforming into the United Federation of Earth and its Colonies. By 2207, in response to the growing autocratic authority of the U.F. and numerous reports of human rights violations, several star systems declare sovereignty from the Federation, eventually forming the Coalition of Sovereign Territories, which would later inspire various other secessionist movements. In 2210, after enduring terrible negotiations and peace treaties, the United Federation and Coalition officially declare war, prompting what would become a bloody conflict in human history.

On June 11, 2212, the Federation launches Operation Lioncrest; a disastrous planetary assault which resulted in the deaths of millions of military personnel and the surfacing of reports of civilians being fired upon by U.F. forces, as well as the mysterious desertion of highly decorated and famed general Walter C. Riggs, taking several ships, materiel, personnel, and military documentation with him. On August 2nd, Federation-aligned systems were attacked by Reticulan military forces, with the alien government later publicly denouncing Humanity, stating that the species is untrustworthy of being a space faring species. By September of that year, in order cease further conflict and to deter anti-alien sentiment amongst humanity, the Eriani willingly enter the newly formed Human-Reticulan conflict as well as the Federation-Coalition war. This however only further fueled resentment, resulting in relations between the Federation and the Martians beginning to deteriorate.

On June 11, 2213, on the anniversary of Operation Lioncrest, reports began to surface of unidentified soldiers attacking Federation armed forces with extreme proficiency and sheer brutality, with many stating that their tactics and maneuvers were outright similar to the Federation’s own. On July 2nd of that year, a powerful video broadcast was transmitted on all frequencies to all of Federation space. The transmission’s sender, the deserted General Riggs, revealed that Jonathan Tobias, prime minister of the United Federation, had given the order to target innocent civilians as a ploy to force the Coalition to surrender. Unable to cope with the atrocity he had committed, General Riggs, along with any other personnel that he managed to convince, went AWOL and fled to uncharted space, managing to amass an army powerful enough to rival the Federation. At the end of the broadcast, General Riggs made his own declaration of war, not only against the United Federation, but to anyone foolish enough to get in the way of him and his army, the Crimson Sword. By December, as the five factions waged bloody war against each other, majority of colonized space was now consumed by conflict, resulting in the formation of the first Galactic War.
